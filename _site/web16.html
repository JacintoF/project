          In Melville's time the people who could get where they were trying to go and exploit the particular niche of that
          area were the ones who got ahead. The same principle applies today, except for the fact that the navigation is
          most often done in cyber space instead of physical. Knowing this, companies employ user experience designers. People
          whose sole job it is to think through the experience they will have on the site. By controlling the experience of
          their navigation and their perception of time and space, companies can subtly influence the customer to do what the company
          wants. Whether that is spending more time on the site to see more ads, or going all the way through the site to complete
          a purchase, how the site is navigated very much affects those endings. Exact positioning in time and space has
          long been important to many different societies, so messing with people's position of those two things becomes very powerful.

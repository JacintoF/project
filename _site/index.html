        Navigation by Birds
      </h5>
      <p class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000">
        The concept of bird navigation is quite simple in that the captains of the boats would simply follow the migratory
        patterns of certain birds. Cuckoo’s led to New Zealand, Pacific Golden plovers led to Hawaii (Valley Isle Excursions). Crews would also
        bring along birds that would refuse to land on water. This was so that they could release the birds and if the
        birds returned, there would be no land in sight, but if the birds did not, land was close by (Thompson).
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000">
        Navigation by Stars
      </h5>
      <p class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000">
        Stars were incredibly important to polynesian navigators as well. Near the equator, the night sky rarely changes seasonally, so each star has a specific path that can be followed. Navigators would measure the elevation of the star with their hands and fingers and that would tell them a specific latitude, that latitude would be attached to an island that the navigators would have memorized. Later they developed star compasses to use for this purpose (Thompson).
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000">
        Navigation by Ocean Swells
      </h5>
      <p class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000">
        Navigators would also use the changes in the ocean swells to determine whether they were close to land or not. Waves would be a product of an island or some other land mass close by. They would memorize how different island shapes and types would affect the water and the way it moves and use that to determine location or course correction if necessary. They also used the reflection of the seafloor on the bottoms of clouds to help navigate once they started to approach their destination (Valley Isle Excursions).

        Mediteranean Navigation
      </h5>
      <p class="text-white text-left">
        In Mediterranean navigation, the rutter and a portolan or chart was used to determine the compass course. This was done by using wind roses and rhumb lines from the charts that had a constant magnetic bearing. The navigators would use the rhumb lines and the wind-rose they were on to determine the location but this would not always work because there may not be an appropriate wind-rose. If that were the case, a ruler and dividers were used to relate the line of the desired course to a nearby rhumb line. A pilot book would then be used as reference to determine the distance from the nearest rhumb line. As always, landmarks and interlinking maps were incredibly helpful in the process (Law 6).
      </p>

      <h5 class="text-white text-left" >
        The north-west European medieval school of navigation
      </h5>
        <p class="text-white text-left">
        This method of navigation hardly used charts. These navigators would often depend heavily on the magnetic compass and the rutter, in tandem with the lead line, which was a way to measure the depth of the ocean floor (Law 6). This was because, unlike in the mediterranean, the open ocean has a rising and falling tide, and it is important for a navigator to know how much water lies between the bottom of his ship and the sea floor. In addition to the tides, the sea floor was not easily seen in the open ocean and therefore landmarks were far more difficult to determine than in the Mediterranean. The lead and line were very useful in this sense because they did not depend on good visibility and were easy to use in shallower waters such as the northern atlantic shore (Law 6).

                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50"> IMPORTANCE OF QUADRANTS: Quadrants were wood or brace, quarter circles that had different angle markings on the curved edge.

Quadrants were incredibly helpful in determining longitude and latitude (Isil).</p>

                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">Furthermore, Melville also makes reference to this chart created by Lieutenant Maury which charts the migration of whales.</p>
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">IMPORTANCE OF CHARTS: Nautical charts are incredibly important for navigation because it provides the navigator with loads of information about the shape of the shoreline, the depth of the ocean at certain parts, locations of potential dangers, and important anchoring locations for the vessel. Without charts, ships would be lost at sea with no idea what to look for (NOAA).</p>

However, the ship was actually heading west. Ahab then calls for the crew to bring him objects so that he can make a compass himself “that will point true as any” (Melville).</p>
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-50">IMPORTANCE OF COMPASSES: The magnetic compass is a tool designed to always point north. This was particularly useful when clouds blocked out the sun or the north star. Knowing north allowed navigators to know the rest of the cardinal directions and determine which direction they were heading (Calvo).</p>

                  calculations, the readings from all the aforementioned technologies are completely worthless. Furthermore,
                  it is significant that Ahab performs these calculations on his whalebone leg. This firmly ties him not only

        Modern Similarities to Melville
      </h3>

      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        While my father was in the U.S. Navy, the main method of navigation was still paper charts, just like ones Ahab
        would have used. He surmises that some
        newer ships would have more computer systems, but that ships would at the very least have backup paper charts. While
        My father said they most often used known current charts and some simple calculations
        to figure out where they are. This technique is called dead reckoning. The distance gone combined with the estimated drift
        due to the currents would be used to figure out where they currently were. as opposed to the veins whales swim in, this
        technique was known and accepted to often be inexact. However, my father stated that when they were in the middle
        of the Atlantic with nothing around, it did not matter if they were a few miles off from where they thought they were.
        To figure out where they wanted to be, gnomonic charts, which gave the shortest path between two points on a glove, were common.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        The technique Ahab uses when making calculations on his whalebone leg is known as local apparent noon, and was
        also used. Local apparent noon may be even more inexact than dead reckoning though, so while still an option, it
        was not commonly used.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        While many advancements have been made to prevent things such as the lighting strike which messes with the compass
        onboard the Pequod, that does not mean there are no longer technological issues. Occasionally the engines onboard
        the USS Nicholson would just give out. Without the engines, there was no power onboard the boat. This meant dead
        reckoning, local apparent noon, and celestial navigation were basically the only options for the time being, just as
        if they were back in the time of Melville.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-white text-left" style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px #000000; padding-top: 5px">
        Modern Differences to Melville
      </h3>

      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        While Melville likes bending time and adding ambiguity, the navy did not. They recognize that to navigate
        accurately you need super accurate clocks. The team under the command of the navigator had to wind a super
        accurate chronograph each day and log that this task was done.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        Since Melville's time, advancements in in compass technology have come a long way. The magnetic compass on the ship
        had two large steel balls around it which would be moved to calibrate the compass in order to prevent interference
        due to metals on the ship as well as things such as lightning strikes. Furthermore, in addition to traditional
        magnetic compasses gyro compasses were used to find true north.
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        Command structures onboard ships have also changed over time. Besides lower officers getting more time to eat, most
        of this change can be seen as a diffusion of responsibilities. Rather than just the captain navigation, my father was there just beneath the captain.
        But even more than jsut my father, as mentioned before, he had a team of navigators under him. Most of the time while
        out to sea niether him or the captain would actually be on the bridge. Instead my father would leave written orders
        signed by the captain for whoever was up there. Then if anything important happened they could call him up. Coming into port
        was a whole ordeal and it is where the differences really stand out. Instead of just one person such as Ahab calling the shots,
        there were many many people to check and recheck everyone to catch any little errors. The whole navigation team
        would be at the bridge, the port would often provide a pilot to help guide the ship in, the helmsman would have a helm safety
        officer to make sure the helmsman actually turned the ship the correct amount of degrees and to the direction ordered.
        The one command dynamic I noticed stayed the same was how possesive people were over their role and how afraid they were
        of losing command. My father to this day was upset when talking about the pilots coming onboard because they became
        a new person that could overrule him and some were "idiots" that "didn't know how to steer his ship".
      </p>
      <p class="text-white-50 text-left">
        The biggest and most obvious differences in navigation between modern day and what Ahab had available is GPS and
        radio navigation. When sailing along the coast radar would be used to position themselves relative to the coast.
        If near a port, there were sometimes even buoys with radar reflectors that would reflect morse code to this
        ship in order to indicate which port exactly they were at. Getting further out Loran-C radio navigation was used.
        Loran-c was a long range, highly accurate hyperbolic radio system which allowed the ship to communicate with land
        based radio beacons to determine their position. Finally, when far out at sea GPS was used. However during the
        time my father was in the navy GPS only would give a read out of latitude and longitude, which then had to be placed
        on a paper map.

          in a normal word document. For reference, the google document full of text for this website was ten pages long.
          Pay attention to how this changes and how much more you are aware of length when
          from here on out you have to click to another page after every paragraph.

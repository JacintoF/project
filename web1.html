          I find it interesting how the largest industry of today, tech, is still playing with time just like industry was
          during Melville. The difference is, of course, that back then the railroads and ships wanted to exactly quantify time. They
          wanted to break it up into nice little chunks, even across the entire country. They wanted a super accurate
          and exact representation to have better maps. Meanwhile, tech today wants to understand time and people's
          interpretation of it, essentially to make it go away. Clicking "Next Paragraph" doesn't seem so bad after one
          or two clicks. But the little movements becomes very noticeable after ten, twenty, a hundred times. This bends
          a viewer's perception of time. Let's straighten it back out.
